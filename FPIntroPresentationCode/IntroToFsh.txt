F# Presentation agenda
What is the main idea/goal?
To make people interested in fSharp, or at least leanrning another language that has similar features

I. General overview of the presentation - intro to f# in the light of javascript and c#

II. Plan

1. What is most important to you? (Кое е най-ванжното) - Да ядеш на уя блажното :)
 What is most important feature of C#

	My efforts:  
		- create plan for the presentation
		- practice the presentation to see how much time it takes
		- create the voting app, deploy and make it visible
		- recompile the presentation after voting is finished
	
	Presetation view:
		Slide 1 -> guestion(What is most important feature of C#) + link to voting app (10 mins)

		Slide 3 (C#7 features - main message  - 
		C# has been getting features that are part of other languages, since version 2)
		(Some of those languages are so called "functional" languages)
		
		
	
	Q: How to make the switch between c# and the need to look at f#?
		1.(Slide 4) C# is getting more expressive and functional? It seems so...
			2. Then why bother learn other language, even more functional one, at all?
				1. What is functional anyway?
					Def: A style of programming where the basic method of computation is application of functions to arguments. 
					Q: What other styles we know? Style of programming where the basic method of computation is changing of state
					through statements AKA imperative. 
					
				2. Langauges like C# make it possible to write code in functional style. But it is hard and
				these languages do not encourage and facilitate writing in functional style
					2.1 Features that are just coming are not natural to the language or not complete
					Natural: Local functions; pattern matching, destructuring, AGT
					Not complete: (patern matching, destructuring, AGT(algebraic data types))
						2.1.1. Since Features are not natural you will gain only limited understaing of their use, pros/cons
					or you will hear the (somewhat correct) advice: "Do not use that" this is bad practice/dangerous
					
					2.2 You will not see the every-day task/problems solved with 
					those features (best example - higher order filter, map, iter, vs their loop equivalents)
					Beginning C#, Java, etc. programmers are not taught these languages in functional style
					(The first things you learn is reading and writing to console, and asigning to variables.
					After that: if, swith, statements come, while, for, statements)
					
				3. "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing." Alan Perlis
					Java (object oriented, statically typed, garbage collected languages, will not significatly affect the way you think)
					
					3.1. Thinking about problems in new ways. Different approach, different view of the world (not better, but different) 				
			
		(Slide 5 Why F#?)
			1. Personal (1-2 min)
				a. have heard that F# is used in competitive industry as finance, where tooling can give edge
				b. I friend of mine who is doctor of CS speaks with great love of F#
				c. I liked how simple some things are with javascript/jquery/lodash, and especially liked 
				the lodash higher order functions
				d. I disliked how every class that I`ve seen eventually becomes uncoherent bag of methods
				(It looked to me as a module( from the JS module pattern))

			2. "Techical" (to the extend these can be called techincal)(1-2 min) - 
				a. I wanted the language to be used in some industry ( opposed to research languages)
				and be somewhat mature(Lisp family(Closure, Scheme, LISP), Scala, Haskell, FSharp, Ocaml, Erlang)
				b. I did not like LISP family syntax (Scala, Haskell, FSharp, Ocaml, Erlang)
				c. I was afraid that diving into pure FP might be to much effort (Scala, FSharp, Ocaml, Erlang)
				d. I wanted to have language that is used on a popular platform, where a lot libraries exist(Scala, FSharp)
				e. I preffered F# due to familiarity with platform 
					(learning new platform and new paradigm and algoritms and data structures could be too much to handle) 
					
		(Slide 6 F# - Wikipedia)
			a. mature
			b. functional-first
			c. cross-platform
			d. open-source
			e. implementation of Ocaml on .Net
	
		(Slide 7 - More features)
			a. statically typed
			a. with type inference
			b. immutable by default
			c. exression oriented
			d. compatible with other .NET languages
			
		
		(Slide 8 - First steps)
			- The REPL (enter a few simple values and and say that you will be using Alt + Enter)
			- No variables - only immutable bindings (explain output on the REPL (val it : int = 4); 
			Common form - val "identificator" : "type" = "value")
			- (value) bindings have types
				- primitive (string , int float)
				- more complex = list, array, seq, tuple 
				- the Unit type
		(Slide 9 functions - main properties in theory)
			- No Side effects
			- same output for same input
			- Has exacly one input and one output
		(Slide 10 Demo first steps - functions, values, compiler, expressions in F#)
			- (almost)everything is expression(what is the difference between statement and expression)
				pros: -> 
					- expressions are composable(will see in a while)
					- easier to inspect independently
					- easier to refactor (imagine long if statement where not all branches return - can not easily extract it to a functions)
				cons: almost any
				
				since everything is expression, there is no return statement - the output of a function is the last expression
			- function bindings
				- also have types (form val "indentificator" : "ident1": "inputType1" -> ... -> "identN": "outputType")
				- different types
				- seeing the unit type in a function signature - a-> unit or unit -> a :
				    means that the function is doing site effects
			- Generic params (compiler tries to infer the most generic type). Generucs are fully supported
			- higher order functions (functions that return functions or functions that receive other functions as params)
			- partial application				
				
		(Slide 11 - Demo (Access to .NET))
			- short description of the problem to solve - just write some names to a file
			- mutable arrays - syntax;  not idiomatic structure for functional programming but best for the goal
			- local functions to keep code closer to where it is declared
			- binding can contain
			- everythng is expression if then - else is the analog of the thernaly operator; 
				all paths must return the same value
			- Writing to a file - easy interoperability
		(Slide 12 - Demo more basics, read the data written to the fail and do some stuff)
			- record similar to POCO, POJO, Javascript plain objects
			- type inference needs help with 'dot' notation (objects`members)
			- partial application
				- first-class function can be bint to identifier 
				- Partial application helps in specializing functions
				- ease of creating small functions improves readability 
				(remember magic strings, numbers. Same with functions)
				- gives us control over when to get result
			- declare getPerson (with and without lambda)
			- read the file into personInfos
			- make simple transformation and query of the data	
				    get people with 3th most met first name ordered by age and displayed:
    				(Name: LastName, FirstName; Age: age)

					- simple helper functions
					- more specialization and readibility with 'getFirstAndLastName'
					- get people with third most common name
					- "display format" function
					- get result
		(Slide 13 can we do "better" - refactoring code, the pipeline operator)
			- inflix / postfix
			- our first library - ala fluent interfaces (almost :))
			- change 'thirdMostCommonFirstNamePeople' to function
		(Slide 14 can we improve even more?)
			- function composition
			- refactor "getThirdMostCommonFirstName" function
			- refactor toDisplayFormat
		(Slide 15 changing reqs - third most common hobbies)
			- limitations of type inference
			- refactor function by adding types
		(Slide 16 problems - Core language)
			- very different, intimidating at first 
			- new features that have to learned
			- very hard to fit into existing mindset
				"It is not only the violin that shapes the violinist, 
				we are all shaped by the tools we train ourselves to use, 
				and in this respect programming languages have a devious influence: 
				they shape our thinking habits."
		(Slide 17 problems - myths negative)
			- Only for academics: 
				https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dsyme/2011/03/15/netc-generics-history-some-photos-from-feb-1999/
			- unpractical, nobody uses them exept scientists
			- u should understand maths to use them
			- FP is not good for large systems,
			- FP is slow (not performant)
			- function and oop are opposing 
				(bulshit - Javascript, Scala, FSarp, O(bjective)caml)
				(the real enemy are mutable state and poor OOP languages, 
				which to see the world only as objects)
		(Slide 18 problems - myths positive)
			- OOP sucks(its actually langs like java and due, to its core, c#. 
			Also c++ is described as huge mess, OOP in JS is ugly) and FP rules
			- look how elegant quicksort is: 
				tip if somebody tells you that quicksort is superelegant do no trust them
				this is not a quicksort
			- will solve all your problems			
			- parallelization is much easier?
		(Slide 19 problems - myths misc)
			- its Haskell(pure functional language) and all the others
				- Haskell is not the only "pure" functional language
				- what is pure anyway? in Haskell
			- its LISP and all the others
				no to both - there lots of languages that have functional facilities
			- functional programming is all about functions	
				- not at all, it s just as much about data structures
			- functional languages are all the same
				- the total bullshit (same goes for OO languages, too)
		(Slide 20 problems - communities)
			- almost all languages have small communities relative to main OO/imprative langs
				- lacking tooling, frameworks
				- lacking education materials
				- lacking enough success stories
				- are not the first choice when introducing to programming
		(Slide 21 problems F# specifically)
			- seen as second-class citizen in .NET(tooling, official support) - 
				but this attitude diminishes
			- .NET is havoc - transitioning to open sorce

		(Slide 22 what was the app built in?)
			 front end - Vue.JS
			 backend - ASP.NET WebAPI (using c#)
			 azure

		speaking about the app....

		(Slide 23 -> ...survey results (links to relevant articles)) 
			Visit each site and make short explanation (5-10 mins - questions might arise)
			Some of most inportant features come from functional languages
			(Genercis, LINQ, async style, Nullable)
		
		(Slides 24 -> javascript, most wanted features)
